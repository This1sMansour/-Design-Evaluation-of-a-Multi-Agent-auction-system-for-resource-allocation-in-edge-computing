# Design Evaluation of a Multi Agent auction system for resource allocation in edge computing

The task is to design and impliment a prototype of an auction which is most fit for the edge computing, and then implementing it by putting agents in the environment, and then depending their behaviour evaluate the sytem.

I have used double auciton with the clearing price protcol, which allows the buyer and seller to land on a price, which both benefit from.
For the agents, the way they are designed is, they will be compatible to have different behaviours depending the settings that was given to the system, from fully greedy to fully selfless.

C# programming language, and ActressMas .NET framework was used for this work.
